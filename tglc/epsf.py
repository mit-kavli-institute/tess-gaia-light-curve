    Construct the TGLC design matrix from equation (3) of Han & Brandt, 2023.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : tuple[int, int]
        Shape of image (FFI cutout) that will be used as observed data.
    psf_shape_pixels : tuple[int, int]
        Extent of ePSF array in pixels.
    oversample_factor : int
        Factor by which to oversample the ePSF compared to image pixels.
    star_positions : array
        Positions of stars in image with shape (n, 2). The first column is `x` and the second column
        is `y`. Same order as `star_flux_ratios`.
    star_flux_ratios : array
        Ratio of flux from each star to maximum flux from any star, where flux is calculated using
        catalog brightness for each star. Shape (n,) and same order as `star_positions`.

        Scale factor used when forcing edges of ePSF to 0. This is only needed during fitting (not
        forward modeling) and produces extra rows in the output. If omitted or set to `None`, no
